## Stage 3: Technical Documentation

### Objectives

- Translate project objectives and requirements into a detailed technical plan.
- Define user stories and mockups to clarify functionality where applicable.
- Design and document architecture, components, classes, database structures, or collections as applicable.
- Create high-level sequence diagrams illustrating interactions between components or services.
- Specify external services (APIs) and define internal API endpoints with input and output formats.
- Plan source control management (SCM) and quality assurance (QA) strategies for code lifecycle and testing.
- Justify all technical decisions based on functional or non-functional requirements, constraints, or expert recommendations.

### Importance of Stage 3

This stage ensures that the team creates a comprehensive blueprint for building the MVP. By planning technical aspects, source control, and quality assurance in advance, the team reduces risks, improves clarity, and enhances the development process. The documentation also aligns all stakeholders on the projectâ€™s technical direction.
