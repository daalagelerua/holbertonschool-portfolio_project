## Part 2 - Project Charter Development

### Objectives

- Introduce students to the basics of project management by creating a simple yet structured project document.
- Define the projectâ€™s purpose, objectives, scope, and key elements at a high level.
- Identify and document stakeholders, roles, risks, and other critical aspects.
- Outline a high-level project plan that demonstrates how the project will progress through its various stages.

### Importance of Stage 2

The **Project Charter** serves as the foundation for all subsequent work.

It establishes a shared understanding of the project among team members and stakeholders and provides a reference point for decision-making throughout the project lifecycle.

By engaging in this activity, students will:

- Learn to structure and formalize project information.
- Develop clarity on what needs to be accomplished and why.
- Gain experience in identifying risks and roles, which are crucial for effective project execution.
